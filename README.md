Cordon, the first level from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl. Has SupplyRaid points.

Some things are still a work in progress. 

Lighting is very rough. The map has a lot of small issues, including some gaps in geometry, and anomalies that don't properly do anything. Highly recommended to use mobility tools, this map is quite large.

Please report any major issues on the github page

If you want to play sandbox, just walk away from the supplyraid start screen.
